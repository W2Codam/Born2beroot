# Born2beroot
This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization,
using [DebianOS](https://www.debian.org/) & VirtualBox VM.

## Note
The project is relatively straight forward, its more that you have to battle with the subject itself as some things can be very unclear. However I will try my best to document this project to the best of my ability.

### Skills
- Rigor
- Network & system administration
